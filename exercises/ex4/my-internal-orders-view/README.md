3. Drag and drop the view **_V_INTERNAL_ORDERS_** into the canvas, which you have created previously.
  >:mortar_board: **Note**: the properties and semantics from the previous view will be inherited to the new view, such as Measure classification, Attributes Semantics, etc. In the future also Input Parameters, Associations, Text and Hierarchy definitions will be reusable.

8. Map the **V_MY_INTERNAL_ORDERS.COMPANYCODE** column to the Data Access Control **D_COMPANYCODE.ALLOWED_VALUE** column.
   >ðŸŽ“Note: With the mapping, the data access of the view _V_MY_INTERNAL_ORDERS_ is now secured by filtering the data on _Company Code_ with user's allowed values. If user does not have valid entries in the _T_DAC_DATA_ table, he will not be able to see any value.

### Data Preview
10. Select on the _Output_ Node the Data Preview from the context menu. As a result you should not see any data, since your user does not have any valid access maintained in the table **T_DAC_DATA**. This will be part of the next exercise :)
